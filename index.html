<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>Thank your for your interest in this Data Carpentry workshop.</> 
</br>

<p>The ever-increasing digital nature of research requires researchers, postgraduate students, and research-support staff to equip themselves with the skills to create, manipulate and manage data in digital format. This can involve complex research data management techniques.  However, very often researchers and students can perform simple to complex data management by mastering tools and techniques which donâ€™t require the purchase of pricey software licenses nor necessitating highly specialist skills.</p>
<p>This workshop will assist researchers, postgraduate students, and research-support staff to learn more about such tools and techniques </p>
<p>The workshop is organised and funded as part of the DST-funded National e-Science Postgraduate Teaching and Training Platform (NEPTTP) and in cooperation with the <a href="https://goo.gl/MedPb8" target="_blank">South African Center for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR)</a> 

</br>
<h2>Workshop Aims</h2>
<p>This workshop aims to provide a broad introduction to the following concepts and tools</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Introduction to Digital Scholarship</li>
   <li>Research Data Management</li>
   <li>Data formatting, cleaning, and manipulation using OpenRefine</li>
   <li>Introduction to R for analysing data</li>
  </ul>
</br>
<h2>Registration and other information</h2>
<p><strong>Please register</strong> for the workshop through the online <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/qZoyHYLIvr3MBzih1" target="_blank">registration form</a> by 28 January 2018. 
	Registration is free of charge, <strong>although a penalty fee of R500 will be charged for no-shows</strong> . Space is limited, if you have any questions please contact 
	<a href="mailto:juan.steyn@nwu.ac.za?Subject=WITS Data Carpentry workshop 31 January 2018" target="_top">juan.steyn@nwu.ac.za</a>. </p>
</br>
<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org target="_blank">Data Carpentry</a> workshops are for any graduate student, staff member or researcher 
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. 
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more 
effectively with data. 
</p>
<p>
We will cover Digital Scholarship, Data organisation in spreadsheets, Data cleaning with OpenRefine and Data analysis and visualisation in R. 

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
</p>

<!--

Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
You will need to download OpenRefine and install it,
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.</p>

  SYLLABUS



  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry based workshop, you will need working copies of the 
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download 
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use 
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow 
once you leave the workshop.
<p>
Please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
